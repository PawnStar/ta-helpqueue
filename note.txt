In order to enter the queue you need to send a post to /helpqueue/queueUp.php with post data of:
username: netId
question: your question
passOff: true/false

This is sent as x-www-form-urlencoded, the response is a json string similar to the other status objects

Basically, use:
  $.ajax({
    url:'https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs236ta/helpqueue/queueUp.php',
    type:'post',
    dataType:'json',
    data:{
      username:'netID',   //Doesn't work if this is not your netID
      question:'',        //Haven't done much experimentation here.  Possible XSS vulnerability?
      passOff:false       //non-boolean values don't work
    }
  })


If you call removeFromQueue.php on a user that is not you, it adds them to the students being helped list
  under your net id (as in they are being helped by you)

If you call removeFromQueue again, it removes them.

=====

If you don't want to have to traverse the list looking for yourself, you can also query getStatus.php with
your own netID.  If the returned object has non null enqueueTime, you're in the queue.  Also if you're not
in the queue the spot property will be -1.  0 is in the queue and currently being helped.

A good way to test if you are in the queue or not is to query getStatus.php with your own netID
